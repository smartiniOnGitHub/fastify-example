Example webapp with Fastify


## Setup and run

To complete project setup, do:
```
npm install
```

and run with
```
npm start
```

then point your browser to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)


## Setup and run with Docker

Note that it's possible to let Docker do all inside a container, because 
all is described in a Dockerfile; see [Dockerfile-usage](./docs/Dockerfile-usage.md) 
for related commands.

Of course you need a local installation of Docker (recent, if possible latest), 
but nothing other.


## Setup and run with Docker images at DockerHub

**DEPRECATED**

Published images for this project at DockerHub are at 
[smartiniatdocker09/fastify-example](https://hub.docker.com/r/smartiniatdocker09/fastify-example/), 
but *pay attention because they are all outdated* (last push was approx. at 2021-04).

Default images are based on default Node.js Docker image and contains 
development dependencies too (to reload content, run tests, etc), BASH shell, etc; 
there are even others:
- a variant one based on official Node.js Alpine Linux image, 
  which is minimal (smaller, a lot) and is tailored for running in Production 
  (dedicated user for running the webapp, no dev dependencies, no reload, etc)
- another based on official Distroless images for Node.js (from Google), 
  small (but bigger than those based on Alpine Linux) and without a lot of stuff inside 
  (there is no shell for example), so not so simple to debug but good for production environments
Note that "normal" images are not so small (approx. 900 / 1000 MB) and could contain some vulnerability 
in some packages already installed in the OS, so pay attention 
if/when using them in production environments.

For example, you can run directly with:
`docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -t smartiniatdocker09/fastify-example:latest-alpine`
and browse to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
Published Docker tags are 'latest', 'latest-alpine', 'latest-distroless', 
and starting from source code tag '2.7.0' there is:
the same tag, and even the '2.7.0-alpine' and '2.7.0-distroless' variants.
For more info look at [tags - smartiniatdocker09/fastify-example](https://hub.docker.com/r/smartiniatdocker09/fastify-example/tags).

Of course you need a local installation of Docker (recent, if possible latest), 
but nothing other.


## Others

To run a development server (with hot reload enabled) instead execute this:
```
npm run start:dev
```

For other custom commands look the 'scripts' section inside 'package.json'.


## Requirements

Fastify ^3.0.0, Node.js 12 LTS (12.13.0) or later.


## Security

Nothing known.


## Sources

Source code is all inside main repo:
[fastify-example](https://github.com/smartiniOnGitHub/fastify-example).

Documentation generated from source code (API):
[here](https://smartiniongithub.github.io/fastify-example/).


## Note

Some features can be configured via environment variables; 
if a `.env` file is found in project root, all its contents 
will be loaded into environmental variables.
Supported variables:
- `FASTIFY_OPTIONS`, set Fastify main options at startup, as a JSON string; 
  to change logging level for example use something like: `{ "logger": { "level": "debug" } }'
  and to remove logging for example use: '{ }'
- `HTTP_PORT`, set default HTTP port for the server
- `HTTP_ADDRESS`, set default HTTP address for the server
- `NATS_SERVER_URL`, set the URL for the NATS server (if enabled), or plugin default
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY`, set the secret key to require by exposed webhook
- `FEATURE_PLATFORM_INFO_DISABLE`, to disable the logging of some info
  related to the current runtime platform like:
  Node.js version, OS name, Fastify version, Webapp version, etc ...
- `FEATURE_CHECK_RUNTIME_ENV_DISABLE`, to disable (not load) related plugin; 
  if enabled and current Node.js environment is not compatible with the one 
  set in 'package.json' by default it will throw an exception, 
  so the webapp will crash (to avoid running the webapp in a not compliant env)
- `FEATURE_FAVICON_DISABLE`, to disable (not load) related plugin
- `FEATURE_WEBHOOK_DISABLE`, to disable (not load) related plugin
- `FEATURE_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLE`, to disable (not load) related plugin
- `FEATURE_CLOUDEVENTS_DISABLE`, to disable (not load) related plugin; 
  note that this by default uses a public NATS server so disable it 
  if not needed or if that server is not reachable for corporate firewall policies
- `FEATURE_CLOUDEVENTS_STRICT_DISABLE`, to disable strict mode in generated CloudEvents 
  (if/when related plugin is enabled)
- `FEATURE_CLOUDEVENTS_LOG_CONSOLE_DISABLE`, to disable CloudEvent serialization to console
- `FEATURE_CLOUDEVENTS_LOG_FILE_DISABLE`, to disable CloudEvent serialization to console, 
  by default true (so disabled); 
  note that when enabled a new log file will be created at any run of the server, 
  but previous (if present) will be overwritten, 
  so any new run is fresh and old logs will be discarded
- `FEATURE_NATS_DISABLE`, to disable (not load) related plugin
if not specified default behavior will be applied.

As a sample, by default (unless disabled) some messages will be sent to a NATS queue, 
when the web application has started and when a client ask for a page.
NATS server by default (in related plugin) is a public one, 
[demo.nats.io](nats://demo.nats.io:4222).
